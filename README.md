# A brief comparasion of sorting algorithms

This repo contains my first activity regarding a university course: Methods and Practices in Informatics. It contains the following sorting algoritms:
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort 
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort 
- Counting sort
- Cocktail sort
- Tim sort

Also you in the *Generators* folder you can find the input generators I used.
